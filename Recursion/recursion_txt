what is recursion?
--> function calls itself called recursion (calls its cop itself)

Algorithmetic approaches uses by recursion 
    Generally,
        1. Decrease and conquer approach
            \ reducing by substraction or division
               \ only one sub problem (ie., only one recursive call in the recurrence relation)
        2. Divide and conquer approach 
            \ reducing by substraction or division
                \ a problem is sub-divided / reduced into more than one subproblem
        3. Backtracking
            \ 

General part of recursion
    1. Base condition(s) or Stopping condition(s)
        \ known solution to stop the recursive call
            \ when we are using the function with return type then this condition require 
            \ when we are using the function without return type then base condition is optional 
        
    2. Recurrence relation 
        \ recursive call(s) towards the base condition(s)


Types of recursion
=> Direct Recursion
    1) Tail
    2) Head
    3) Tree
    4) Nestedls -a
